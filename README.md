# Setting up a new page on test.hki.com

1. Visit http://test.hki.com/Sitefinity/Pages?lang=en and click "Create a Page"
2. Name the page. In the "Template" section, choose "Select another Template", scroll up to find the HKI Glass template, select it, and click "Done". Click "Create and go to add content" at the bottom of the page.
3. If you want multiple columns, go into Layout mode (top-right corner), pick a columns layout from "Single and Two Columns", and drag it into the pink box that says "Drag layout elements" in the center of the page. Be sure to drag it directly into the center of the pink box; if you drop it too high or too low, your columns will span the entire width of the page, leaving no margin at the edges. When your columns are all set up, switch back to Content mode (top-right corner).
4. Drag a content block from the "Drag widgets" column on the right into the "Drag widgets here" area in the center of the page.
